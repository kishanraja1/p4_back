#Technologies Used 
*Django REST Framework
*Spotify as a 3rd Party API
*Postman

#Approach Taken 
*Styling was a continuous effort. Below are other steps we took to create this app:
*1. Build a Django REST Framework Project as a starting point
*2. Create two apps in our poject: artists and albums
*3. Designate API endpoints for both artists and albums and test using Postman
*4. Obtain permissions for Spotify API
*5. Create API endpoints for Spotify API use
*6. Deploy to Heroku for use on the front end.

#Unsolved Problems
